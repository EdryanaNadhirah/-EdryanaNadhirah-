so basically what i did is a bit of frontend and backend, i tried to connect it with mysqli using xampp to manage the data. 
might need to polish more as i only dabble a bit with mysqli. i noticed that my codes can have sql injections which means people
can leak their data without having to enter their username and password whatnot.

hopefully i can get a better way to secure the data.
